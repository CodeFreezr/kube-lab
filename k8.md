# Codelets (not only) for the Kubernetes Ecosystem

## Weil einfach einfach einfach ist <> Because simple is simple simple.
  
kubernetes shell commands (kubectl, kubeadm, minikube, etc.) could be rather long.  
Sometimes soo long that you think you would copy & paste them. 

Sometimes you would create and share a combination of some code.

Together with a Default-Store for Default-Values we would think to simplify cli stuff a lot, and bring more fun into cli based devopsing.
  
So we will start a series of shortener codes (codelets). To prepare we will collect some requirements and do some first pseudo-code, that code I want to type in.  
  
### Examples:
#### Run App from Image
* `kubectl run my-bootcamp --image=gcr.io/google-samples/kubernetes-bootcamp:v1 --port=8080`  
abstract to  
* `kubectl run {$app-name} --image={$default-image} --port={$default-port}`  
leads to  
* `k8 run my-bootcamp`

#### List Deployments:
* `kubectl get deployments`  
leads to  
* `k8 get deps`  

#### Get Pod-Name:
* `export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -o go-template --template '{{range .items}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}') && echo Name of the Pod: $POD_NAME`  
leads to
* `k8 get pod`

### Pros
* No Copy Paste hastle
* Good to remember, learn and find
* Cross-Reference inside
* gitbased team approach to be repitable
* A bit FDD/BDD approach. (FeatureBehavior Driven Development)

### Requirements
* Portable: Linux, Mac, Win
* value-store (etcd, .properties, yaml, json, ...)
* Easy to adopt locally (git clone)
* Easy to add upstream request (git "pull request")
* Every codelet coud start 
  1. with a new doc page (md or wiki?)
  2. with a pull request of the main readme.md
  3. as a part of an abstractor-script from the original command
* Setup Command 
  1. (Requirement as Wiki-Page (md) > 
  2. Pull Request > 
  3. Vote > 
  4. DevQA-B4 > 
  5. Implement > DevQA > Build > Integrate)
* generate command completion

### Pseude-Code
* [d] [v] [s] [p]  
[d] domain like k8, jf, do  
[v] verb like list, run, get, describe  
[s] sub means subject or subdomain like container, app, cluster, node  
[p] param one single string build up with param-name:value,param-name:value  


### Selfcontained
* [d] list verbs (All verbs with Short-Description)
* [d] list subs (All Subjects, with Shortdescription)
* [d] list defaults (What is in default-store)
* [d] update (Update the codelet
* [d] version
* [d] help
* [d] [v] help - Verb specific help
* [d] [s] help - Sub specific help
* [d] [v] [s] help - Verb / Sub specific help

### Not only k8 domains:
* k8 - Most important Commands from the kubernetes universe
* aw - Most important aws cli commands
* jf - Most importanten jfrog (artifactory commands)
* do - Most important Docker Commands
* jk - Most important Jenkins commands

### Similar Stuff with different approaches:
* jx (allready done for jenkins x)
* oc (Openshift Command)

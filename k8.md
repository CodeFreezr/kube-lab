# Weil einfach einfach einfach ist - Because simple is simple simple.
  
kubernetes shell commands (kubectl, kubeadm, minikube, etc.) could be rather long.  
Sometimes soo long that you think you would copy & paste them.   
  
So I will start a series of shortener commands. To prepare I will collect some requirements and do some pseudo-code, that code I want to type in.  
  
## Example:  


## Pros
...  

## Requirements
* Portable: Linux, Mac, Win
* value-store (etcd, .properties, yaml, json, ...)
* Easy to adopt locally (git clone)
* Easy to add upstream request (git pull request)
* generate docs
* generate command completion

## Pseude-Code
* k8 

## Do also:
* k8 
* aw 
* jf 
* do
